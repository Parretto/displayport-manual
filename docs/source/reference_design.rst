Reference Design
================

The reference design is shown in figure 3.
The reference design consists of the modules DisplayPort TX (DPTX), DisplayPort RX (DPRX), Video Toolbox (VTB), SERDES and application. 

The VTB is a collection of video helper modules. It has a timing generator, colorbar generator, FIFO and video clock recovery. 

The reference design has two operation modes; colorbar and pass-through. 
In colorbar mode the test pattern, generated by the VTB, is transmitted by the DPTX to the DisplayPort sink device.
When the pass-through mode is selected, the video coming from the DisplayPort source is captured by the DPRX. Then the video is forwarded to the DPTX through the VTB. 

The application has a RISC-V processor, memory (rom and ram) and a set of peripherals. 

The RISC-V processor runs the application code and DisplayPort IP-core host driver. 

The I2C peripheral is used to configure the external reference clock synthesizers (PHY and video clocks). 

The SERDES registers are accessed through the DRP / LMMI peripheral. 

The application or parts of it can be replaced by other customer modules.
